        <h4>I am Julie Norseth, a 31 year old student and mother living in Northern Utah. I have had interest in
          technology and web design from a young age, and hope to expand my interest and passion into a career.
          Graduating from BYU-I is my next goal in that pursuit. I will graduate on Dec. 15th with a BS in Applied
          Technology with Web Development and Systems Administration Certificates. I also received my CCNA as part of my
          Senior Project.<br><br>
          I've been married to my husband Chris for 11 years. We met while attending Weber State University. I left
          school to stay home with our children while he finished his degree in Supply Chain Management. He has
          supported and cheered me on as I have gone back to finish. We have four kids, all girls, and are so grateful
          for the life we have been blessed with. In my free time I love crochet, graphic design, reading, gardening,
          and camping. </h4>
